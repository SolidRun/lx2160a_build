Subject: [PATCH 17/21] arm64: dts: lx2160a-clearfog-itx: set fixed link for
 qsfp ports

As QSFP is not currenly supported in the Linux kernel no attempt is made
to model this detail of Honeycomb and Clearfog-CX boards.

Vendor bootloader used to set up the ethernet ports which are routed to
qsfp connector as fixed links in MC firmware depending on selected
serdes protocol.
These firmware side fixed links worked on linux side without any
explicit configuration.

The LX2160A also supports runtime configuration of network protocols on
ethernet ports and serdes lanes using generic phys. This requires
changing the interface type on firmware side to type "PHY".

The standard SFP ports on Honeycomb / Clearfog-CX already rely on
interface type "PHY" to report link and switch ethernet protocol at
runtime based on SFP module properties.

When interface type is on firmware side is "PHY", dpaa2 driver
configures ethernet ports based on runtime information such as SFP
modules properties and reported link status, or a dedicated phy on mdio
bus.

In lack of actual QSFP support set up the affected ethernet ports for
fixed 10Gbps link, and enable their respective pcs nodes.
This ensures that when firmware set interface type "PHY", the port and
serdes lanes are configured properly to allow TX and RX of packets.

It also simplifies configuration for users by allowing selection of
interface speed (e.g. 10 or 25Gbps with serdes 1 protocol 18) in
device-tree rather than firmware.
