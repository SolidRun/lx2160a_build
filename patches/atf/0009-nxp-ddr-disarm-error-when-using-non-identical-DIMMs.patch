Subject: [PATCH 09/15] nxp: ddr: disarm error when using non-identical DIMMs

Some DDR4 SO-DIMM report different timings when they are installed in
different slots. This triggers an error as LX2160A intends to only
support identical DIMMs.

Disarm the error and continue with timings read from first DIMM SPD.
An error is printed advising users to carefully check their memory.
